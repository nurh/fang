The Fang Operating System.

I’m doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won’t be big and
professional like Linux) for multicore ARM and x86 machines,

This project was just to get me started on ARM development, but I've
since added x86. Pandaboard ES is being dropped as the hardware is
dead in the water.

## Goals

* Right now, just bringup from baremetal and getting output via serial.
* Initial target boards are raspberry pi 2 and intel edison. 
* More may be added.
