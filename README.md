The Fang kernel.

I’m doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won’t be big and
professional like Linux) for multicore aarch64 machines.

This project was intended to start ARM development, but since the
proliferation of aarch64 I've decided to focus exclusively on that
platform instead. All other board support is dropped.

## Goals

* Bringup for aarch64 in Qemu.
