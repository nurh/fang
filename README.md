The Fang Operating System.

I’m doing a (free) operating system (just a hobby, won’t be big and
professional like Linux) for multicore ARM machines.

This project is just to get me started on ARM development. 

## Goals

* Right now, just bringup from baremetal and getting output via serial.
* Initial target platform is the pandaboard es and raspberry pi 2. More may be added.
