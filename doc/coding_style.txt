Fang Coding Style
=================

Preferred coding style for the Fang kernel closely resembles the one
for the Linux kernel, and that in turn closely resembles K&R C.

Indentation
-----------
1. Tabs not spaces.
2. Tabs are 8 characters.
3. Set your editor to behave accordingly.
4. Use K&R braces.
5. Do not indent the case labels in switch statements afer the 
   opening brace.

Include files
-------------
Include files need to be guarded with #ifndef/#define/#endif. 

For a file foo.h, the guard style is:

#ifndef __FANG_FOO_H
#define __FANG

/* Function goes here */

#endif /* __FANG_FOO_H */

It's good to label the #endif at the end with a comment telling you where
the #ifndef ends.
